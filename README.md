# ultrasonic-The-final-code-
Ultrasonic interfacing with TM4C123GH6PM (ARM-cortex-M4) using WTIMER0, TIMER0, 1, 2 & 3 (PC4, PC5, PF0, PF1, PF2, PF3, PB0, PB1, PB2 & PB3) for echo pin and (PE0, PE1, PE2, PE3, PA2, PA3, PA4, PA5, PA6 & PA7) for normal use as GPIO pins for trigger pin and display the results on UART0 on PA0 and PA1.
I use all those pins because i use 10 ultrasonic sensors in a project.
